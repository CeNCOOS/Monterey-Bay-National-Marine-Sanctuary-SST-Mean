This Repository has several purposes.  The first is to push CeNCOOS work.
This is my first test using GitHub so excuse problems with layout and input.

One branch contains a simple carbonate chemistry code.

The other branch contains a Python Notebook to compute a mean SST over the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  Other Sanctuary boundaries are also included.
